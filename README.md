[TODO]


## Working For Me

1. I hate the term *working for me*.  Why did I used it?  I don't have any better term to describe the generic situation.
1. How I prioritize you:
    1. The Person - We always do what's best for you.  The definition of "best" changes over time.  I expect that change, and welcome keeping you aligned with today's definition of best.
    1. The Interesting Problem - I only work at companies that address the problems I'm interested in addressing. As with the definition of "best", the definition of an "interesting problem" changes.  Let's keep you alinged to what interesets you the most.
    1. The Company - Companies & Organizations are communities we choose for mutual support.  Generally, these communicites focuse on a narrow problem set that changes at a slower rate thatn what is either best, or interesting, for you.  All we need to do is ensure we left the community in a better place than when we started.
1. Career advancement is a team sport.  I'm a player/coach on the field with you.  We do what's in your best interest.
    1. If your best interest does not align with team or the organizations priorities, we will find you the next best option anywhere on this planet.
    1. If you need help, and I can help you; I will help you.
    1. If you need help, and I cannot help you; We will search for the help you need.
